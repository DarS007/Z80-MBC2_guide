Just a word of caution:  Z80-MBC2 is **NOT** a typical microcomputer you might know from 70’s and 80’s of the previous century. You will **NOT** find here a **glue logic** you might be familiar with. Instead, get ready for a new, genius concept of merging two worlds: AVR/ATmega and Z80. 

ATmega plays a role of system supervisor that prepares a comfortable environment for it’s Z80 mate. And only when everything is ready, Z80 is enabled to run and execute it’s user code.

This mimics well the modern ‘software-defined XXX’ trend. Z80 clock, for instance, is generated by ATmega and it’s value can be controlled by the software (4 or 8 MHz). The same with hard disks (emulated by ATmega and SD card) or serial interface (emulated by ATmega).
